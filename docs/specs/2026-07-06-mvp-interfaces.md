# Sub-project 1 — Multiplexing MVP — Locked Interface Contract

**Status:** Locked. Every implementation task MUST conform to these types and
signatures exactly. If a signature must change during implementation, the change
must be applied consistently to every consumer named here.

**Amendment (sub-project 2, Task 4):** the `input` section below was extended
with new `Action` variants (window/session/detach bindings), a new
`InputEvent::Captured` variant, and a new `InputMachine::set_capture` method.
See [`2026-07-07-server-client-interfaces.md`](2026-07-07-server-client-interfaces.md)
for the session/window model these new actions dispatch into.

**Parent spec:** [`2026-07-06-multiplexing-mvp-design.md`](2026-07-06-multiplexing-mvp-design.md)

## Crate layout

Single binary crate `winmux`, Rust edition 2021.

```
src/main.rs      — entry point: install panic hook, call app::run(), map error to exit code
src/geom.rs      — Rect, Direction (shared geometry)
src/layout.rs    — split tree (pure logic, no I/O)
src/grid.rs      — per-pane terminal emulator state (vte-driven)
src/render.rs    — compositor + cell-diff renderer (pure logic, no I/O)
src/input.rs     — prefix-key state machine (pure logic, no I/O)
src/pty.rs       — ConPTY wrapper (windows-rs)
src/host.rs      — host terminal control (windows-rs)
src/app.rs       — event loop wiring
```

## Dependencies (Cargo.toml)

```toml
[dependencies]
vte = "0.13"
windows = { version = "0.58", features = [
    "Win32_Foundation",
    "Win32_Security",
    "Win32_Storage_FileSystem",
    "Win32_System_Console",
    "Win32_System_IO",
    "Win32_System_Pipes",
    "Win32_System_Threading",
] }
```

(`Win32_System_IO` was added during implementation: windows 0.58 gates
`ReadFile`/`WriteFile` behind it. The `app` task adds
`Win32_System_SystemInformation` for `GetLocalTime`.)

`vte` is pinned to 0.13: `Parser::advance(&mut performer, byte)` takes a single
byte. If a pinned version fails to resolve or compile, the implementer may bump
it but must fix all resulting API differences in the same task.

## `geom` — shared geometry

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
pub struct Rect { pub x: u16, pub y: u16, pub w: u16, pub h: u16 }

#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
pub enum Direction { Left, Right, Up, Down }
```

`Rect` coordinates are 0-based host-terminal cells; `x` grows rightward, `y`
grows downward.

## `layout` — split tree (pure)

**Amendment (sub-project 4, Task 5 — mouse):** `resize_focused` is now a thin
wrapper over a new, more general `resize_from(&mut self, pane: PaneId, dir:
Direction, area: Rect, cells: u16) -> bool`, which takes an explicit
reference leaf instead of always using `self.focused` — needed for mouse
border-drag resize, which must be able to move a border adjacent to a pane
that ISN'T currently focused, without changing focus. `resize_focused`'s own
signature/behavior is unchanged. See the `## mouse` section of
[`2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md`](2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md).

**Amendment (sub-project 4, Task 6 — layout presets, swap-pane,
rotate-window):** three additions, all still pure (no I/O):

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum LayoutPreset {
    EvenHorizontal,
    EvenVertical,
    MainHorizontal,
    MainVertical,
    Tiled,
}

/// `next-layout`'s cycle order; also the canonical index (0..=4) stored in
/// `model::Window::last_layout`.
pub const PRESET_CYCLE: [LayoutPreset; 5] = [ /* the 5 variants above, in order */ ];

impl LayoutPreset {
    pub fn name(self) -> &'static str;             // "even-horizontal", ...
    pub fn from_name(s: &str) -> Option<LayoutPreset>; // exact match only
    pub fn cycle_index(self) -> u8;                 // position in PRESET_CYCLE
}

impl Layout {
    /// Rebuild the split tree from scratch as one of the five presets.
    /// `panes` is the CALLER-supplied pane order used for placement
    /// (position 0 is the "main" pane for MainHorizontal/MainVertical) --
    /// callers pass CREATION order (ascending PaneId), not `self.panes()`'s
    /// current tree order, so a preset re-applied after a swap/rotate stays
    /// pinned to the same placement regardless of how the tree got
    /// scrambled. `main_width`/`main_height` are the `main-pane-width`/
    /// `main-pane-height` option values, clamped internally so the main pane
    /// is >= MIN_PANE_W/H and the other panes are too. A single pane always
    /// just fills `area`. Focus is preserved if still present in `panes`
    /// (else falls back to `panes[0]`); zoom is cleared. No-op if `panes` is
    /// empty.
    pub fn apply_preset(&mut self, preset: LayoutPreset, panes: &[PaneId], area: Rect, main_width: u16, main_height: u16);

    /// Swap the CONTENTS of the two leaves holding `a` and `b` (each pane
    /// keeps its id; they trade tree/screen positions). `self.focused`
    /// stores a PaneId, so a focused pane that is one of `a`/`b`
    /// automatically "follows" to its new position -- no explicit focus
    /// bookkeeping. Clears zoom. `false` (no-op) if `a == b` or either id
    /// isn't a leaf of this layout.
    pub fn swap_panes(&mut self, a: PaneId, b: PaneId) -> bool;

    /// Rotate every pane's content through the tree's leaf positions by one
    /// step. `forward` shifts each position's content to what the PREVIOUS
    /// leaf position held (content moves one position later, wrapping last
    /// -> first); `!forward` is the mirror. Focus follows the SCREEN CELL
    /// (leaf position), not the pane -- whichever position was focused stays
    /// focused, now showing whichever pane rotated into it. Clears zoom.
    /// `false` (no-op) with 0 or 1 panes.
    pub fn rotate(&mut self, forward: bool) -> bool;
}
```

Rounding rule for every preset's even splits: remainder cells go to the
EARLIER (leftmost/topmost) entries first (`even_lengths`, a private helper).
`tiled`'s rows-first grid: `rows=cols=1; while r*c<n { r+=1; if r*c<n {
c+=1 } }`; a short final row's panes are spread evenly over the row's OWN
pane count (not the full `cols`), so the last pane in a short row ends up
wider than a normal column ("last short row spans"). Deviation from the SP4
design spec's `Layout::rotate(forward: bool)` signature: none — the
parameter name and meaning match; only the mapping from
`rotate-window`/`-D` to `forward` was a judgment call (see
`cmd`/`server::dispatch` amendments in
[`2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md`](2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md)'s
`## layout-presets` section) since neither the task brief nor the design
spec pin down the exact `-D`/bare direction-to-permutation mapping.

```rust

    /// (right for Horizontal, bottom for Vertical) and RECEIVES FOCUS
    /// (tmux default). Returns Err(SplitRefused) if either resulting pane

    /// Splitting clears zoom first (tmux behavior).
    pub fn split(&mut self, dir: SplitDir, new_pane: PaneId, area: Rect)
        -> Result<(), SplitRefused>;

    pub fn focused(&self) -> PaneId;

    /// Geometric navigation: move focus to the pane adjacent in `dir`, per

    /// (`window_pane_find_{left,right,up,down}`, window.c; see
    /// `docs/tmux-reference/panes-and-layout.md` §1.1). Two rules:
    ///
    /// 1. **Edge-flip wrap.** The search edge is normally the column/row
    ///    immediately touching the focused pane's near side; but if the
    ///    focused pane is already flush against that side of `area`, the
    ///    edge flips to one past the FAR side, so candidates become the
    ///    panes flush against the opposite edge -- navigation wraps (e.g.
    ///    Left from the leftmost pane reaches the rightmost), symmetric in
    ///    all four directions.
    /// 2. **MRU tie-break.** A candidate is any pane flush against the
    ///    (possibly wrapped) edge AND whose cross-axis range genuinely
    ///    OVERLAPS the focused pane's cross-axis range (a real
    ///    interval-overlap test, INCLUSIVE at the boundary: a candidate
    ///    whose near edge lands exactly on the focused pane's far boundary
    ///    still counts, per tmux's `window.c:1992-1998` one-past-edge
    ///    convention -- corner-touching-only candidates are not excluded;
    ///    2026-07-10 review fix, closes the pre-existing strict-`<` gap
    ///    from the 2026-07-08 hotfix). Among multiple candidates, the one with
    ///    the greatest `activity(pane)` value wins (tmux's real
    ///    `active_point` recency counter, `window_pane_choose_best`); ties
    ///    (e.g. every candidate still at its caller-supplied default)
    ///    resolve to whichever was seen FIRST in leaf/pane-index order,
    ///    since only a strictly-greater candidate ever replaces the running
    ///    best.
    ///
    /// `activity` is read-only and caller-supplied: `Layout` itself has no
    /// counter (its per-window `last_focused` field is retained ONLY for
    /// [`Self::focus_last`], the `prefix ;` toggle -- an unrelated feature).
    /// Real tmux's `active_point` counter is global across the whole
    /// server (meaningful across windows/sessions), so it is owned and
    /// stamped by the server (`Server::pane_activity` /
    /// `Server::stamp_active`, `src/server.rs`) at every
    /// `window_set_active_pane`-equivalent call site (explicit selection,
    /// directional navigation, last-pane toggle, mouse focus, rotate,
    /// spawn-time creation -- but NEVER on `window_lost_pane`-shaped
    /// death handoffs, nor on break-pane's recycled pane
    /// (cmd-break-pane.c:158 assigns `w->active` directly): tmux
    /// reassigns the active pane WITHOUT bumping the counter in both
    /// cases; see `Server::stamp_active`'s doc for the full stamp/
    /// no-stamp map), and threaded in here as a closure. This
    /// replaces the old single-slot `last_focused`-based MRU approximation
    /// (follow-up #65, now resolved).
    ///
    /// Returns false (no change) if there is no candidate in that direction.
    //
    // Hotfix note (2026-07-08): the original implementation tested only
    // whether the focused pane's cross-axis MIDPOINT fell inside a
    // candidate's range. When the focused pane spans the full cross-axis
    // length opposite a split column/row (e.g. a full-height pane next to a
    // top/bottom split), that midpoint could land exactly on the border
    // between two candidates and match neither, so directional navigation
    // silently no-op'd. Replaced with the real interval-overlap test kept
    // above (unaffected by the 2026-07-10 wrap/MRU signature change below).
    //
    // Signature change (2026-07-10, SP6 parity wave 2 Task 3): added the
    // `activity` parameter and the edge-flip wrap rule described above.

```

## `grid` — per-pane terminal emulator

**SUPERSEDED (sub-project 4, Task 1):** `Grid::new` gained a third
`history_limit: u32` parameter, and `Grid` gained `history_len`, `view_cell`,
`view_row_text`, `title`, and `take_title_changed`. Real scrollback capture
and a real (save/restore) alternate screen replaced the MVP's "no scrollback,
alt screen just clears" behavior; OSC 0/2 now capture the pane title instead
of being ignored. See the `## grid-v2` section of
[`2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md`](2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md)
for the full current contract. This section is kept for historical reference
only; everything below it describing scrollback-free/OSC-ignored MVP behavior
is superseded.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
pub enum Color { Default, Idx(u8), Rgb(u8, u8, u8) }

#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
pub struct Style {
    pub fg: Color,
    pub bg: Color,
    pub bold: bool,
    pub dim: bool,
    pub italic: bool,
    pub underline: bool,
    pub reverse: bool,
}
impl Default for Style { /* all flags false, both colors Color::Default */ }

#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Debug)]
pub struct Cell { pub ch: char, pub style: Style }
impl Default for Cell { /* ch: ' ', style: Style::default() */ }

pub struct Grid { /* private; owns a vte::Parser + emulator state */ }

impl Grid {
    pub fn new(cols: u16, rows: u16) -> Self;
    /// Feed raw VT bytes from the pane's ConPTY output.
    pub fn feed(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]);
    /// Content is clipped (shrink) or padded with default cells (grow);
    /// cursor is clamped into range.
    pub fn resize(&mut self, cols: u16, rows: u16);
    pub fn cols(&self) -> u16;
    pub fn rows(&self) -> u16;
    pub fn cell(&self, col: u16, row: u16) -> Cell;   // panics out of range
    // Hardening note (follow-up #6, resolved sub-project-2 Task 10): the
    // panic message is `"cell({col}, {row}) out of bounds {cols}x{rows}"`,
    // including both the requested coordinates and the grid's dimensions.
    pub fn cursor(&self) -> (u16, u16);               // (col, row)
    pub fn cursor_visible(&self) -> bool;             // DECTCEM state, default true
}
```

**vte borrow pattern (required):** `Grid` holds `parser: vte::Parser` and a
separate `state: TermState` where `TermState: vte::Perform`. `feed` iterates
`self.parser.advance(&mut self.state, byte)` per byte. (A single struct cannot
be both the parser owner and the performer.)

**VT support scope** (what PowerShell + typical CLI tools emit):
- Printable chars with autowrap (DECAWM on by default, `CSI ?7 h/l` honored).
- C0: BS(0x08), HT(0x09, 8-col tab stops), LF(0x0A), CR(0x0D), BEL(ignored).
- CSI: CUU/CUD/CUF/CUB (`A B C D`), CNL/CPL (`E F`), CHA (`G`), CUP/HVP (`H f`),
  ED (`J` 0/1/2), EL (`K` 0/1/2), ICH (`@`), DCH (`P`), ECH (`X`), IL (`L`),
  DL (`M`), SU (`S`), SD (`T`), DECSTBM (`r`), save/restore cursor (`s`/`u`),
  DECTCEM (`?25 h/l`).
- SGR (`m`): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 22, 23, 24, 27, 30–37, 39, 40–47, 49, 90–97,
  100–107, 38;5;n, 48;5;n, 38;2;r;g;b, 48;2;r;g;b.
- ESC: `7`/`8` (save/restore cursor), `M` (reverse index).
- Alt screen `CSI ?1049 h/l`: MVP treats enter as "clear screen, home cursor"
  and leave as "clear screen, home cursor" (no saved primary screen; no
  scrollback in MVP so nothing is lost).
- OSC (titles etc.): parsed and ignored. Unknown sequences: ignored, never panic.
- Lines scrolled off the top are dropped (no scrollback in MVP).

    /// swap, and return the VT byte stream to write to the host terminal.
    /// `cursor` is the absolute host position for the real cursor

}
```

**Compositing rules (amended SP3 Task 8 — option-driven styles):**
- Pane cells copy from `grid.cell(...)` into the pane's rect; cells outside
  any pane rect (borders) are drawn with box chars `─ │ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼`
  (junction-aware; glyph logic unchanged since the MVP). Border cells
  adjacent to the focused pane use `Scene::border_active`; all other border
  cells use `Scene::border` (defaults reproduce the old hardcoded fg-green /
  fg-default). When zoomed, no borders. Panes and borders never draw on the
  status row (whichever row `StatusRow::top` selects); with `status: None`
  they may occupy every row, including the bottom one.
- Dead pane: its grid still renders; the string `[exited]` is overlaid in
  reverse video at the pane rect's top-left (skipped if the rect's top row
  IS the status row).
- Status row (`Scene::status: Some`): drawn on row 0 when `top`, else the
  bottom row; the row is filled with `base`-styled spaces, then `spans` drawn
  left-to-right starting at col 0, each span's cells carrying that span's own
  resolved style (SGR is always emitted as one combined `\x1b[0;...m`
  sequence per style change — see `sgr()`), then `right` right-aligned in
  `right_style`; middle padded with spaces; truncate right-first if too
  narrow (left length for this purpose is the sum of all spans' char counts).
  `Scene::status: None` (`status off`): no status bytes are emitted at all.
- Message (`Scene::message: Some((text, style))`): replaces the status row's
  content, filling that row with `style`; when `status` is `None` it overlays
  the BOTTOM row instead.
- **Overlay pass (SP4 Task 8), painted LAST:** `Overlay::List` clears the
  ENTIRE client area to the default style, paints an optional title row (row
  0, default style), then `rows` (each padded to full width: selected in
  `Scene::mode_style`, others default style), scrolled so `top`'s row is the
  first shown below the title. If `Scene::message` is also `Some` (e.g.
  choose-tree's `x` kill-confirm prompt), it takes the panel's own LAST row
  (reserved before laying out `rows`, painted after them so it always wins)
  instead of the ordinary status-row placement above — the panel would
  otherwise have already overwritten it. `Overlay::PaneDigits` paints, for
  each `(rect, digit, active)`: a centered 5x5 block-digit bitmap (space
  cells in `display_panes_colour`/`display_panes_active_colour`) when `rect`
  is at least 6 wide x 5 tall, else a single centered glyph in the same
  colour (a "small-number fallback", `rect.w == 0 || rect.h == 0` paints
  nothing) — touching only cells inside each listed pane's rect, leaving
  everything else (borders, status, other panes) untouched.
- Diff emission: for each changed cell, emit minimal CUP (skip if the cursor is
  already adjacent from the previous emitted cell) + SGR (only on style change)
  + the char. UTF-8 encode chars. Reset SGR (CSI 0m) at stream end.
- **Default-byte equivalence (Task 8 invariant):** with all options at their
  tmux defaults, `compose` emits byte-for-byte the same stream as before this
  amendment — pinned by the unchanged expected byte strings in `render.rs`'s
  default-styled unit tests and the untouched `tests/e2e.rs` /
  `tests/e2e_sessions.rs`.

## `input` — prefix state machine (pure)

**SUPERSEDED (sub-project 3, Task 6):** `Action`/`InputEvent`/`InputMachine`
below were DELETED from `src/input.rs` once `src/server.rs` was rewired onto
the table-driven `KeyMachine`/`KeyInputEvent`/`Bindings` pipeline — see the
`## input-v2` and `## bindings` sections of
`docs/specs/2026-07-07-command-config-interfaces.md` for the replacement
(locked) contract, and that same file's `## server-dispatch` section for how
the server resolves `KeyInputEvent::Key` against the mutable bindings table
and dispatches the resulting commands. This section is kept for historical
reference only — every behavior it describes (split/focus/resize/zoom/close/
window nav/rename/detach/switch-client) is reproduced exactly by
`crate::bindings::Bindings::default()`'s commands, unit-tested in
`bindings::tests::defaults_cover_current_behavior`.

```rust

use crate::layout::SplitDir;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]

    Split(SplitDir),
    Focus(Direction),

    ToggleZoom,      // prefix z
    Resize(Direction), // prefix Ctrl-arrow, repeatable
    Quit,            // internal: not bound to a key in MVP (app exits when last pane dies)

    /// call like `Forward`.
    Captured(Vec<u8>),
}

pub struct InputMachine { /* private */ }

impl InputMachine {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    /// Feed raw stdin bytes; `now` drives the resize repeat window
    /// (REPEAT_TIME below). May buffer an incomplete escape sequence
    /// internally across calls.
    pub fn feed(&mut self, bytes: &[u8], now: Instant) -> Vec<InputEvent>;
    /// App arms/disarms confirm mode after Action::RequestClose.
    pub fn set_confirming(&mut self, on: bool);
    /// Added in sub-project 2. Turn raw capture mode on/off. While on,
    /// `feed()` bypasses all state-machine dispatch (Prefixed/Repeat/

    /// — including the prefix byte and escape sequences (no parsing).
    /// Turning on clears any pending escape-sequence buffer and prefix
    /// state, mirroring `set_confirming`. Capture takes precedence over
    /// Confirming if both were somehow set (capture is checked first in
    /// `feed()`, independently of the underlying `state`). Turning off
    /// resumes Normal.
    pub fn set_capture(&mut self, on: bool);
}

pub const PREFIX: u8 = 0x02;                       // Ctrl-b
pub const REPEAT_TIME: std::time::Duration = std::time::Duration::from_millis(500);
```

**State machine semantics (tmux-exact):**
- Normal: bytes stream to `Forward` untouched, except `0x02` (consumed, arms
  Prefixed). Coalesce consecutive forwarded bytes into one `Forward`.
- Prefixed (next key is a command, consumed):
  - `%` → `Action(Split(SplitDir::Horizontal))` (left|right)
  - `"` → `Action(Split(SplitDir::Vertical))` (top/bottom)
  - Arrow keys (`ESC [ A/B/C/D` = Up/Down/Right/Left) → `Action(Focus(dir))`
  - `o` → `FocusNext`; `;` → `FocusLast`; `x` → `RequestClose`; `z` → `ToggleZoom`
  - Ctrl-arrows (`ESC [ 1;5A` etc.) → `Action(Resize(dir))`, then enter
    Repeat state until `now + REPEAT_TIME`.
  - `0x02` again → `Forward(vec![0x02])` (send literal Ctrl-b)
  - anything else → disarm silently (swallow the key).
  - An incomplete `ESC`-sequence tail is buffered until the next `feed`.
  - Added in sub-project 2, also consumed and returning to Normal: `c` →
    `NewWindow`; `n` → `NextWindow`; `p` → `PrevWindow`; `l` → `LastWindow`;
    `0`..=`9` → `SelectWindow(digit)` (u32 digit value, not the ASCII byte);
    `&` → `RequestKillWindow`; `,` → `RenameWindow`; `$` → `RenameSession`;
    `d` → `Detach`; `(` → `SwitchClientPrev`; `)` → `SwitchClientNext`.
- Repeat: a Ctrl-arrow within the window → another `Resize` and the window
  restarts. Any other input → leave Repeat, process that input as Normal.
- Confirming (set via `set_confirming(true)`): next key `y`/`Y` →
  `ConfirmClose(true)`; any other key → `ConfirmClose(false)`. Either way the
  machine returns to Normal (the app also calls `set_confirming(false)`).
  Keys in this mode are consumed, never forwarded.
- Capture (added in sub-project 2, set via `set_capture(true)`): every byte,
  regardless of what `state` would otherwise dispatch to — including the
  prefix byte and escape sequences — comes out as `Captured(bytes)`, raw and
  unparsed, coalesced per `feed()` call. This check happens before any
  `state` match, so capture wins even over Confirming if both flags were
  somehow set at once. `set_capture(false)` resumes Normal.

## `pty` — ConPTY wrapper

```rust
pub struct Pty { /* private: HPCON, process + thread handles, pipe handles */ }
pub struct PtyReader { /* private: owned dup of the output read handle */ }

impl Pty {
    /// Create pipes + CreatePseudoConsole(cols, rows) + spawn `cmdline` with
    /// PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE via CreateProcessW
    /// (EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT).
    pub fn spawn(cmdline: &str, cols: u16, rows: u16) -> std::io::Result<Pty>;
    pub fn resize(&self, cols: u16, rows: u16) -> std::io::Result<()>;
    /// Reader for the dedicated reader thread. Blocking Read; returns Ok(0)
    /// or ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE (map to Ok(0)) at EOF.
    pub fn take_reader(&mut self) -> std::io::Result<PtyReader>;  // once; Err on second call
    pub fn write_input(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) -> std::io::Result<()>;
    /// Raw process HANDLE value (as isize) for a waiter thread to
    /// WaitForSingleObject on. The Pty retains ownership.
    pub fn process_handle_raw(&self) -> isize;
    pub fn pid(&self) -> u32;
}
impl std::io::Read for PtyReader { /* ... */ }
impl Drop for Pty {
    // TerminateProcess(child), ClosePseudoConsole, close handles — in that
    // order; ClosePseudoConsole unblocks any reader stuck in ReadFile.
}
```

**ConPTY exit protocol (important):** ConPTY's output pipe does NOT reliably
EOF when the child exits; a waiter thread per pane does
`WaitForSingleObject(process_handle)` and sends `Event::Exited(pane_id)`. The
app then marks the pane dead and drops the `Pty`, which closes the
pseudoconsole and unblocks the reader thread.

## `host` — host terminal control

**Amendment (sub-project 4, Task 5 — mouse):** the shared restore sequence
(`apply_restore`, run by both `Drop for Host` and the panic hook) now writes
`CSI ?1000l ?1002l ?1006l` (disable xterm mouse reporting: normal tracking +
button-motion + SGR extended coordinates) UNCONDITIONALLY, ahead of the
pre-existing `CSI ?1049l ?25h 0m` (leave alt screen, show cursor, reset SGR)
— i.e. every exit path (normal exit, error, panic) now ALSO disables mouse
reporting on the real terminal, regardless of whether the server ever told
this client to enable it. Terminal-restore invariant (extended): a
crashed/killed server, or a bug that forgot to send the `l` sequences before
a client detached, can never leave the user's real terminal with mouse
reporting stuck on — writing the disable sequences to a terminal that never
had them enabled is a harmless no-op (per the SGR mouse protocol, an `l` for
a mode that was never `h`'d does nothing). No signature change; `Host::enter`/
`Host::write`/`Drop`'s documented byte sequence is otherwise unchanged. See
the `## mouse` section of
[`2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md`](2026-07-07-parity-polish-interfaces.md)
for the enable-sequence (server) side of this feature.

**Amendment (sub-project 2, Task 8):**

- `Host::enter()`'s internal ordering changed (follow-up #3): every value
  needed to restore the console (code pages via `Get*`, console modes via
  `GetConsoleMode`) is now gathered FIRST, the `RESTORE` snapshot is
  published, and only THEN do the `Set*` mutations (UTF-8 code pages, VT
  processing / raw stdin mode) run. Previously the code pages were mutated
  before `RESTORE` was published, so a panic between those two steps would
  have left the panic hook/`Drop` restoring a snapshot that didn't yet
  reflect the just-mutated code pages. Observable behavior of `enter()`
  (final modes, alt-screen entry) is unchanged; only the failure-window
  ordering is tightened.
- New free function `pub fn console_size() -> std::io::Result<(u16, u16)>`:
  queries `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` against `STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE` directly
  (shares its `srWindow`-based calculation with `Host::size` via a private
  `query_size` helper), without constructing a `Host` — no mode changes, no
  alt-screen entry. Used by `main.rs` to size the initial `Attach` frame
  (and as an 80x24 fallback source) before deciding whether to become an
  attached client at all.

```rust
pub struct Host { /* private: saved stdin/stdout modes */ }

impl Host {
    /// Save current console modes, then: stdout += ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING
    /// | DISABLE_NEWLINE_AUTO_RETURN; stdin = ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT
    /// | ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS (raw: LINE/ECHO/PROCESSED/QUICK_EDIT off, so
    /// Ctrl-C arrives as byte 0x03). Then write alt-screen enter
    /// (CSI ?1049h) + clear.
    pub fn enter() -> std::io::Result<Host>;
    pub fn size(&self) -> std::io::Result<(u16, u16)>;  // (cols, rows)
    pub fn write(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) -> std::io::Result<()>; // write + flush stdout
}
impl Drop for Host {
    // Disable xterm mouse reporting (CSI ?1000l ?1002l ?1006l — Task 5,
    // sub-project 4, unconditional), leave alt screen (CSI ?1049l), show
    // cursor (CSI ?25h), reset SGR, restore saved console modes. Must be
    // infallible (ignore errors).
}

/// Install a panic hook that performs the same restoration as Drop before
/// delegating to the previous hook. Safe to call once from main().
pub fn install_panic_hook();

/// Blocking read of raw bytes from the console input handle (for the stdin
/// thread). Returns Ok(0) only on handle closure.
pub fn read_stdin(buf: &mut [u8]) -> std::io::Result<usize>;
```

Host resize detection: no event in the byte stream — the app polls
`host.size()` on its tick (see below) and compares.

## `app` — event loop

**Superseded (sub-project 2, Task 8):** `src/app.rs` and its `pub mod app;`
declaration are DELETED. The single-process event loop described below was
replaced wholesale by the server/client split — `src/server.rs` owns the
loop shape server-side (headless, multi-session/window) and `src/client.rs`
+ `src/cli.rs` + `src/main.rs` are the thin client/CLI side. See
[`2026-07-07-server-client-interfaces.md`](2026-07-07-server-client-interfaces.md)'s
`## server`, `## cli`, and `## client` sections. This section is kept only
as a historical record of the MVP's shape.

```rust
pub enum Event {
    Output(crate::layout::PaneId, Vec<u8>), // reader thread
    Exited(crate::layout::PaneId),          // waiter thread
    Stdin(Vec<u8>),                         // stdin thread
}

pub fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>;
```

- One `std::sync::mpsc::channel::<Event>()`; reader/waiter threads per pane +
  one stdin thread all hold clones of the Sender.
- Main loop: `recv_timeout(Duration::from_millis(50))`. On timeout ("tick"):
  poll `host.size()` (resize → recompute layout, `pty.resize` + `grid.resize`
  each pane, `renderer.resize`), refresh the status clock string (re-render
  only if it changed).
- Shell command: `"powershell.exe -NoLogo"`.
- Pane area = full host size minus the bottom status row:
  `Rect { x: 0, y: 0, w: cols, h: rows - 1 }`.
- Status left: `"[winmux] 0:powershell*"`. Status right: local time
  `"HH:MM DD-Mon-YY"` (e.g. `"21:04 06-Jul-26"`).
- Confirm prompt message: `format!("kill-pane {}? (y/n)", pane_id)`.
- Terminal too small (area cannot fit the current tree at minimums): render
  `message: Some("terminal too small".into())` and blank panes; keep running.
- Dead pane: marked dead, still rendered with `[exited]` overlay; `x` (confirm)
  closes it. When the LAST pane dies or is closed, `run` returns Ok → clean exit.
- Zoom, split, close, resize all trigger `pty.resize` + `grid.resize` for every
  pane whose rect changed, then a render.
